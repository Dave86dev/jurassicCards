- The entire project is actually being developed in React using TypeScript, without relying on external libraries or dependencies, aiming to keep the project as independent as possible. The use of libraries such as axios has been dismissed in favor of native fetch methods. I have opted for creating a context through useContext, avoiding the need to install technologies like Redux or MobX for managing the overall state of the application.
